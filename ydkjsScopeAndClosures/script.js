//LHS Lookup: Assignment:

let a = 2;

//RHS lookup: grab the value of the variable in the scope:

/*Today, 8/18/18, I helped Kenneth Solano work in the Chrome
DevTools to run prompts, assign a value to a variable, and
create an object in line with You Don't Know JS: Up & Going.

I also am helping a senior dev write code for a hybrid app
within a private repository that will not show up on Github,
because we're using a private repo on bitbucket.
